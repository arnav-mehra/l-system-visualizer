== What did I make?

I made a web app to visualize l-systems via turtle graphics. Learn about l-systems here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system.

To make specifying the l-system and turtle drawing procedure easier for the user, I  made a fairly simple declarative DSL.  

== Why did I make this?

Heard about the use of l-systems to produce vegetation meshes while looking at some graphics research and thought it seemed pretty neat.

== How did I make this?

React.js and three.js (for displaying 3D shit via WebGL).
