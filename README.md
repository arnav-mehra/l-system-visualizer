## What did I make?

I made a web app to visualize l-systems via turtle graphics. Learn about l-systems here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system.

To make specifying the l-system and turtle drawing procedure easier for the user, I  made a fairly simple declarative eDSL in JS. Click on the info icons next to the form label for more info on how to use the DSL, but it should be easy to figure out based on the given examples. 

## Why did I make this?

Heard about the use of l-systems to produce vegetation meshes while looking at some graphics research and thought it seemed pretty neat. Also, I hadn't really done anything involving WebGL up until this point, so I thought it would be a good learning experience.

## How did I make this?

React.js and three.js (for displaying 3D shit via WebGL).
